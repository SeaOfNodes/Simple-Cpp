# Sea of Nodes - Simple

C++ implementation of https://github.com/SeaOfNodes/Simple

## Status

This is still a **work in progress** and the code is not very readable.

The code is currently equivalent to chapter7 of the main implementation.

Custom Arena allocator comes in chapter 8.

TODO:
 - Fix Graphviz generation for ch8
 - Better tools for debugging
 - some custom functionality for deleting
 - Nicer IRprinter
 - Make sure graphviz output generates good graph
 - Finish off IrPrinter and tools for all the chapters as well as the evaluator
